# FOR 24H/7D LIVE STREAM AT YOUTUBE, CHOICE A VIDEO

## TODO:

        // 1. Initializing an RTMP streaming library.
        // 2. Setting up MediaExtractor to read from videoUri.
        // 3. Setting up MediaCodec for video and audio encoding.
        // 4. Feeding extracted and encoded data to the RTMP library.
        // 5. Managing threading for all these operations.
        // 6. Transitioning the YouTube broadcast state (e.g., to "live") once streaming starts.

        // Example of transitioning the broadcast once you are confident streaming will start:
        // Call this AFTER your RTMP library successfully connects and starts sending data
        // transitionBroadcastState(broadcastId, "live");
